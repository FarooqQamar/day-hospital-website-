This repository contains a simple HTML website detailing the iron infusion and Vitamin B12 injection procedures performed in a day hospital setting. It includes two navigation buttons, "Iron Infusion" and "B12 Injection," linking to pages that explain the benefits of each procedure.

The repository for the Day Hospital website includes:
•	The primary webpage, index.html, which houses the site's fundamental structure and content.
•	A README.md file, offering a concise summary of the website.
•	Two additional HTML pages: 
o	iron-infusion.html, dedicated to explaining the advantages of the iron infusion treatment.
o	vitamin-b12-injection.html, detailing the benefits of the Vitamin B12 injection procedure.
Layout of the website 
The website's layout is simple, clear, basic, and consistent.
My coding experience is zero. I opted for a basic design. I wanted to add images, but I struggled with it. I added the images to the repository to work on it at a later date.
The fonts and colors used are soft and easy on the eye
